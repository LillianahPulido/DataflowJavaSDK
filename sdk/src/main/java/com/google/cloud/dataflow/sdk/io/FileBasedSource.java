  /**
   * A {@link Source.Reader reader} that implements code common to readers of
   * {@code FileBasedSource}s.
   *
   * <h2>Seekability</h2>
   *
   * <p>This reader uses a {@link ReadableByteChannel} created for the file represented by the
   * corresponding source to efficiently move to the correct starting position defined in the
   * source. Subclasses of this reader should implement {@link #startReading} to get access to this
   * channel. If the source corresponding to the reader is for a subrange of a file the
   * {@code ReadableByteChannel} provided is guaranteed to be an instance of the type
   * {@link SeekableByteChannel} which may be used by subclass to traverse back in the channel to
   * determine the correct starting position.
   *
   * <h2>Split Points</h2>
   *
   * <p>Simple record-based formats (such as reading lines, reading CSV etc.), where each record can
   * be identified by a unique offset, should interpret a range [A, B) as "read from the first
   * record starting at or after offset A, up to but not including the first record starting at or
   * after offset B".
   *
   * <p>More complex formats, such as some block-based formats, may have records which are not
   * directly addressable: i.e. for some records, there is no way to describe the location of a
   * record using a single offset number. For example, imagine a file format consisting of a
   * sequence of blocks, where each block is compressed using some block compression algorithm. Then
   * blocks have offsets, but individual records don't. More complex cases are also possible.
   *
   * <p>Many such formats still admit reading a range of offsets in a way consistent with the
   * semantics of {@code ByteOffsetBasedReader}, i.e. reading [A, B) and [B, C) is equivalent to
   * reading [A, C). E.g., for the compressed block-based format discussed above, reading [A, B)
   * would mean "read all the records in all blocks whose starting offset is in [A, B)".
   *
   * <p>To support such complex formats in {@code FileBasedReader}, we introduce the notion of
   * <i>split points</i>. We say that a record is a split point if there exists an offset A such
   * that the record is the first one to be read for a range [A, {@code Long.MAX_VALUE}). E.g. for
   * the block-based format above, the only split points would be the first records in each block.
   *
   * <p>With the above definition of split points an extended definition of the offset of a record
   * can be specified. For a record which is at a split point, its offset is defined to be the
   * largest A such that reading a source with the range [A, Long.MAX_VALUE) includes this record;
   * offsets of other records are only required to be non-strictly increasing. Offsets of records of
   * a {@code FileBasedReader} should be set based on this definition.
   *
   * <h2>Reading Records</h2>
   *
   * <p>Sequential reading is implemented using {@link #readNextRecord}.
   *
   * <p>Then {@code FileBasedReader} implements "reading a range [A, B)" in the following way.
   * <ol>
   * <li>{@code start()} opens the file
   * <li>{@code start()} seeks the {@code SeekableByteChannel} to A (reading offset ranges for
   * non-seekable files is not supported) and calls {@code startReading()}
   * <li>the subclass must do whatever is needed to move to the first split point at or after this
   * position in the channel
   * <li>{@code start()} calls {@code advance()} once
   * <li>if the previous advance call returned {@code true} sequential reading starts and
   * {@code advance()} will be called repeatedly
   * </ol>
   * {@code advance()} calls {@code readNextRecord()} on the subclass, and stops (returns false) if
   * the new record is at a split point AND the offset of the new record is at or after B.
   *
   * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
   *
   * Since this class implements {@link Source.Reader} it guarantees thread safety. Abstract methods
   * defined here will not be accessed by more than one thread concurrently.

# Cloud Dataflow Java SDK (Alpha)

[Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/)
provides a simple, powerful programming model for building both batch
and streaming parallel data processing pipelines.

## Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK)

The Cloud Dataflow SDK is used to access the Google Cloud Dataflow
service, which is currently in Alpha and restricted to whitelisted users.

The SDK is publicly available and can be used for local execution by anyone.
Note, however, that the SDK is also an Alpha release and may change
significantly over time. The SDK is built to be extensible and support
additional execution environments ("runners") beyond local execution and the
Google Cloud Dataflow service. As the product matures, we look forward to
working with you to improve Cloud Dataflow.

## Overview

The key concepts in this programming model are:

* [`PCollection`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/values/PCollection.java):
represents a collection of data, which could be bounded or unbounded in size.
* [`PTransform`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/transforms/PTransform.java):
represents a computation that transforms input PCollections into output
PCollections.
* [`Pipeline`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/Pipeline.java):
manages a directed acyclic graph of PTransforms and PCollections that is ready
for execution.
* [`PipelineRunner`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/runners/PipelineRunner.java):
specifies where and how the pipeline should execute.

We provide three PipelineRunners:

  1. The [`DirectPipelineRunner`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/runners/DirectPipelineRunner.java)
runs the pipeline on your local machine.
  2. The [`DataflowPipelineRunner`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/runners/DataflowPipelineRunner.java)
submits the pipeline to the Dataflow Service, where it runs using managed
resources in the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP).
  3. The
[`BlockingDataflowPipelineRunner`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/sdk/runners/BlockingDataflowPipelineRunner.java)
submits the pipeline to the Dataflow Service via the `DataflowPipelineRunner`
and then prints messages about the job status until the execution is complete.

_The Dataflow Service is currently in the Alpha phase of development and
access is limited to whitelisted users._

Additionally, in partnership with [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/), you can
run Dataflow pipelines on an [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) backend.
The relevant runner code is hosted in
[this](https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow) repository.

## Getting Started

This repository consists of two modules:

* [`SDK`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/sdk)
module provides a set of basic Java APIs to program against.
* [`Examples`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/examples)
module provides a few samples to get started. We recommend starting with the
WordCount example.

The following command will build both modules and install them in your local
Maven repository:

    mvn clean install

You can speed up the build and install process by using the following options:

  1. To skip execution of the unit tests, run:

        mvn install -DskipTests

  2. While iterating on a specific module, use the following command to compile
  and reinstall it. For example, to reinstall the `examples` module, run:

        mvn install -pl examples

  Be careful, however, as this command will use the most recently installed SDK
  from the local repository (or Maven Central) even if you have changed it
  locally.

  3. To run Maven using multiple threads, run:

        mvn -T 4 install

If you are using [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) integrated development
environment (IDE), please additionally review our
[Eclipse integration instructions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/eclipse/README.md).

## Running the Examples

After building and installing, you can execute the `WordCount` and other example
pipelines by following the instructions in this [README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK/blob/master/examples/README.md).
